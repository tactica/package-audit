A useful tool for patch management and prioritization, `package-audit` produces a list of dependencies that are outdated, deprecated or have security vulnerabilities.

`Package::Audit` will automatically detect the technologies used by the project and print out an appropriate report.

## Supported Technologies

* Ruby
* Node (using Yarn)

## Known Issues

1. [RubyGems.org API](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/) produces an incorrect date for the latest version of the [puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) gem. As a result, `puma` is shown on reports as an outdated and a deprecated gem as a false positive.


## Report Example

Below is an example of running the script on a project that uses both Ruby and Node.

## Continuous Integration

This gem provides a return code of `0` to indicate success and `1` to indicate failure. It is specifically designed for seamless integration into continuous integration pipelines.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'package-audit', require: false
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install package-audit
```

## Usage

* To generate a report of vulnerable, deprecated, and outdated packages, execute the following command (optionally providing the `DIR` parameter to specify the path of the project you wish to check, which defaults to the current directory):

    ```bash
    package-audit [DIR]
    ```

* To include a custom configuration file, use `--config` or `-c` (see [Configuration File](#configuration-file) for details):

    ```bash
    package-audit --config .package-audit.yml [DIR]
    ```

* To display the vulnerable, deprecated or outdated packages separately (one list at a time), use:

    ```bash
    package-audit [deprecated|outdated|vulnerable] [DIR]
    ```

* To include ignored packages use the `--include-ignored` flag:

    ```bash
    package-audit --include-ignored [DIR]
    ```

* To include only specific technologies use `--technology` or `-t`:

    ```bash
    package-audit -t node -t ruby [DIR]
    package-audit --technology node --technology ruby [DIR]
    ```

* To include only specific groups use `--group` or `-g`:

    ```bash
    package-audit -e staging -g production [DIR]
    package-audit --group staging --group production [DIR]
    ```

* To produce the same report in a CSV format run:

    ```bash
    package-audit --format csv
    ```

* To produce the same report in a Markdown format run:

    ```bash
    package-audit --format md
    ```

* To show how risk is calculated for the above report run:

    ```bash
    package-audit risk
    ```

#### For a list of all commands and their options run:

```bash
package-audit help
```

OR

```bash
package-audit help [COMMAND]
```

## Configuration File

The `package-audit` gem automatically searches for `.package-audit.yml` in the current directory or in the specified `DIR` if available. However, you have the option to override the default configuration file location by using the `--config` (or `-c`) flag.

#### Below is an example of a configuration file:

```YAML
technology:
  node:
    nth-check:
      version: 1.0.2
      vulnerable: false
  ruby:
    devise-async:
      version: 1.0.0
      deprecated: false
    puma:
      version: 6.3.0
      deprecated: false
    selenium-webdriver:
      version: 4.1.0
      outdated: false
```

#### This configuration file allows you to specify the following exclusions:


* Ignore all security vulnerabilities associated with `nth-check@1.0.2`.
* Suppress messages regarding potential deprecations for  `device-async@1.0.0` and `puma@6.3.0`.
* Disable warnings about newer available versions of  `selenium-webdriver@4.1.0`

**Note:** If the installed package version differs from the expected package version specified in the configuration file, the exclusion settings will not apply to that particular package.

**Note:** If a package is reported for multiple reasons (e.g. vulnerable and outdated), it will still be reported unless the exclusion criteria match every reason for being on the report.

> By design, wildcard (`*`) version exclusions are not supported to prevent developers from inadvertently overlooking crucial messages when packages are updated.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
